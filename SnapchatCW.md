###Different content and its use

The three main ways business can create content on Snapchat are:
Posting to their story, creating Snapchat ads and creating custom AR lenses/filters.

Creating Snapchat ads can be difficult because of the restrictions placed on business and the use case for Snapchat. More than ever, Gen Z request instant gratification in the content they view and are more reluctant than ever to wait for quality simply because there is always more interesting content a few taps away. Snapchat uses this instant nature to its advantage by limiting how long content can be seen for. This forces businesses to be always inventive and fresh in the content they produce. Further more, Snapchat ads must be vertical videos and only last between 3 and 10 seconds meaning content must be instantly eye catching and straight to the point or risk going unnoticed by users.
Creating custom AR lenses and filters is the most unique content type since no other platform offers this kind of content creation to businesses on this kind of scale. Creating Snapchat AR lenses is very expensive, costing between $100,000 and $750,000 for only 24 hours use. This cost is justified by the number if users that will be interacting with your filter and the increased brand awareness that this will bring.
