### Different content and its use

Currently, making use of Instagram stories is one of the best content types on Instagram for businesses. This is because of the decreased amount of traffic on the stories section of Instagram meaning your post will be more impactful because you will not be competing with as many other posts. Instagram now also allows user to post clickable links within story posts which take users straight to a shopping page or to read more about your business. This means that Instagram stories are a great way to divert users away from the cluttered busy Instagram page, to your dedicated page. Whats more, once a user has made the decision to click on a link to a page, they are much more likely to consume more of your content than on a social media site alone.

Similarly to Twitter polls, Marketing companies are encouraging businesses to make more use of Instagram polls to more directly connect with potential customers. A Similar effect can be seen with an increased use of humor among business pages. Instagram has a more light hearted tone when compared to the likes of business pages on Twitter and LinkedIn. This makes humor a more appropriate marking strategy. Common humorous content examples on Instagram include memes and joke videos. GIFs are very rare on Instagram likely because of the low image quality which would stand out against the high standard of photography on most Instagram pages.

### Direct and indirect advertising.

Most Instagram adverts are direct advertising since the adverts anyone sees are directly related to the content they are interested in.
For instance, a social media influencer may be paid by a company who wishes to sell products to a particular demographic. This is more useful to organizations since they have confirmation that their product is only being shown to the most likely customers.

Alternatively, businesses can pay to have their products shown on either peoples feeds or on the explore page. This type of advertising is in some ways more direct since the users are being shown a product purely to try and get them to buy it. This type of advertising relies on Instagram users telling the truth when they set up their account in order to be shown products for them.

### providing special offers

More and more, Instagram ads offer special offers in order to entice people away from their feeds and through third party websites. Sometimes, special offers can be hidden as part of a meme or a more casual style post in order to make it appear that another user is promoting the brand and not the brand themselves. An example would be:
OMG have you got your 50% discount off yet at examplecompany.com !!!
followed by a link to the website containing the discount code.

In addition to creating false user buzz about their products, businesses may also add a strict time limit to their offers to create more pressure on users to buy into the deal before it runs out. Unlike most advertising sales that may last for days or weeks, sales posted on social media may run for just a few hours, to create the most buzz.

### providing customer service

Because of Instagram's predominantly photographic nature, the most common way for companies to interact with customers is through the Instagram comments section underneath each post. For businesses, the most important customer posts to respond to are complaints. This is due to knowledge of bad customer service spreading like wildfire when posted on Instagram. Businesses that respond well and quickly to customer complaints especially if the complaint included a graphic photo of an error by the company, will have the best relationships with their clients.

The integrated Instagram shopping channel is still relatively small meaning most businesses will still try to divert customers to their own websites, meaning most customer service commands happen there.
