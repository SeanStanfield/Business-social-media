## Linkedin

### Different content and its use

LinkedIn Business pages are a common way for people to research about professional bodies they maybe interested in. LinkedIn is not used for selling content but rather for promoting a professional company image and recruitment 

Because of this use case, the content to post on LinkedIn is wildly different to other social media platforms. Advice by Hootsuite believes that the most important content on your LinkedIn page is the homepage as this is where people will form their initial opinions of your business. In particular, the first 156 characters of your bio are the most crucial as this will be what is shown in a Google search preview of your LinkedIn page.

### Direct and indirect advertising

Advertising on LinkedIn is done all through LinkedIn's own advertising system in which businesses can create custom ads. LinkedIn has a guide which outlines the best practices for creating adverts. The main takeaways are:

Use the Integrated AI tool to target the most effective potential customers
If possible, add photos to plain text ads to make them more dynamic and likely to get engagement.
Allow LinkedIn to use their optimization tools to reach customers that you otherwise would not have engaged with.

### providing special offers

Since LinkedIn is a professional service site and not a place to purchase items from, Special offers to customers are rare since there are more effective ways to target customers. non product based organizations may promote themselves and their services on LinkedIn but not to offer financial discounts.

### providing customer service

Again, because of LinkedIn's user base, it is uncommon for them to provide customer service on the platform itself. posting public comments like on Instagram or twitter may seem unprofessional, With that said, LinkedIn does have a built in direct messaging system which is more accustomed to dealing with specific customer requests and queries.

Additionally, most people checked their LinkedIn pages less frequently then say their Instagram page, meaning LinkedIn is a less effective platform when wanting to contact your whole customer base quickly.
