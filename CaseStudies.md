# Case Studies

## University of Loughborough

Loughborough University used a Snapchat geofilter which allowed Snapchat users to use a custom overlay to their snaps when at the Campus. The goal of this campaign was to promote the university open day allowing more potential graduates to gain a positive opinion of the Uni before ever visiting.

### Advantages of this approach.

This approach was very subtle and specific meaning Loughborough University were able to accurately target their target audience. Additionally, the geofilter used the same colour scheme as the University website and merch spreading positive brand awareness.

### Disadvantages of this approach.

Because of the specific nature of the geofilter, Loughborough Uni were not able to reach as many people as if they were using a twitter campaign. Additionally, Snapchat geofilter do not contain much infomation meaning people would not learn much more about the University without doing their own additional research.

### Evaluation

Overall the University of Loughborough have been sucessful in their aims of spreading positive awareness of their university and promoting the kind of activities that the University sees fit. Although the campaign did not spread much infomation. This info is already readily available and was not the main target of the campaign.

## University of California

The University of California has really upped their Instagram page game over the last couple of years. Their Instagram page differs quite significantly from other Universities in that their focus is on the asthetic and quality of content on their page rather than endless posts promoting the University through open days etc.

## Advantages of this approach

This approach has been very successful with the university fetching 30,000 followers and almost 500 likes per post. This is likely because the style of the Instagram page fits more closely with the majority of Instagram pages with a focus on the quality of the photography itself. 

## Disadvantages with this approach

The main disadvantages of this approach are that it becomes harder to share information when the focus of your page is the aesthetic rather than what happens day to day at the university. Also, it will be difficult to keep a regular posting schedule if the Uni wishes to keep up with high quality content at all times.

### Comparison and Evaluation

Overall, I would argue that the university of California's Instagram page has a more profound impact than the Snapchat filters for Loughborough University because the influence is more structured and less time bound.
