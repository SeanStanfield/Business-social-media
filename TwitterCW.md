### Different content and its use

It appears that many businesses struggle with what content they should be posting on social media. This issue is most prevalent with Twitter since the content is the most restrictive of all the large social media platforms whist having a huge audience base making it Even harder to stand out.

Twitter has some guidelines to help businesses with what they should be posting.
Instead of worrying about the number of Tweets they put out, Twitter recommends that businesses create a "regular cadence of content" that is relevant to the target audience. So, what should this content look like...

Text tweets should be short and sweet containing no more than one key message. This will stop the Tweet being dull. Businesses should also make use of images and video attachments to their tweets. According to Twitter, users are up to 3 times more likely to interact with a tweet if it contains an image, GIF, or video.

Similarly, Twitter encourages businesses to increase their use of polls and questions. Along with effective use of Hastags to present your tweet to a target audience, polls and questions encourage twitter users to interact with the tweet, spreading its awareness. Getting users to interact with a tweet will then cause the content to be seen by even more users creating a snowball like effect. Interactive content, even not very good content, will likely be seen by more users than a more static Tweet because of the collective power of connected users.
