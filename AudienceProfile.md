# Audience Profiles.

##What is an audience profile.

An audience profile describes exactly who you are trying to target with a product or campaign. This can be described using an audience avatar which serves as as example for the perfect customer in terms of gender, income, age, and interests.

##Why are they important?

Audience profiles allow businesses to target their campaigns to more specific groups of users. This gives them a better return on investment as they only have to pay to show their advertisements etc to users most likely to be interested in their product.

##Snapchat

Snapchat's user base is predominantly female with only 30% of active users signed up as male. Ofc actual figures may vary.

Snapchat is also more popular with the younger generations (Gen Z and the Millennials)
according to https://www.omnicoreagency.com 78% of 18-24 year olds use Snapchat making it the platform with the most users in this catagory. Because of the age demographic, Snapchat users also tend to earn less than the average social media user. Nevertheless, people who actively use social media tend to earn more than those who don't.

##Twitter

Twitter has a more spread age demographic due to the wider variety of content that can be both posted and consumed.

Only 36% of all Internet users between 18 and 29 use Twitter. A much smaller margin than for Snapchat. Twitter is however, growing amongst older users with 10% of Internet users over 65 using Twitter compared to less than 1% for Snapchat.

## Evaluation

Of these two media platforms, I would argue that Twitter is the best platform for an organization such as Ada because of the more professional style to the content and the broader range of content. Despite Snapchat being the platform of choice for most teens, they are not the only people Ada has to target since the parents of prospective students will also play a large role in choosing their childs further education establishment.
